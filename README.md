## Overview

Rose is an open-source automatic skin changer for League of Legends that enables seamless access to all skins in the game. The application runs silently in the system tray and automatically detects skin selections during champion select, injecting the chosen skin when the game loads.

**Rose is built on two core technologies:**

- **🎮 [Pengu Loader](https://github.com/FlorentTariolle/ROSE-Pengu)**: Plugin system that injects JavaScript plugins into the League Client, enabling enhanced UI interactions and quick skin detection
- **🔧 [CSLOL](https://github.com/LeagueToolkit/cslol-manager)**: Safe skin injection framework that handles the actual skin injection process, fully compatible with Riot Vanguard

These technologies work together to provide a seamless and effortless automatic skin-changing experience without any manual intervention.

## Architecture

Rose consists of two main components:

### Python Backend

- **LCU API Integration**: Communicates with the League Client via the League Client Update (LCU) API
- **CSLOL Injection**: Uses CSLOL tools for safe skin injection
- **WebSocket Bridge**: Operates a WebSocket server for real-time communication with frontend plugins
- **Skin Management**: Downloads and manages skins from the [LeagueSkins repository](https://github.com/darkseal-org/lol-skins)
- **Game Monitoring**: Tracks game state, champion select phases, and loadout countdowns

### Pengu Loader Plugins

Rose includes a suite of JavaScript plugins that extend the League Client UI:

- **[ROSE-UI](https://github.com/Alban1911/ROSE-UI)**: Unlocks locked skin previews in champion select, enabling hover interactions on all skins
- **[ROSE-SkinMonitor](https://github.com/Alban1911/ROSE-SkinMonitor)**: Monitors currently selected skin's name and sends it to the Python backend via WebSocket
- **[ROSE-ChromaWheel](https://github.com/Alban1911/ROSE-ChromaWheel)**: Enhanced chroma selection interface for choosing any chroma variant
- **[ROSE-SettingsPanel](https://github.com/FlorentTariolle/ROSE-SettingsPanel)**: In-client settings panel accessible from the League Client UI
- **[ROSE-RandomSkin](https://github.com/FlorentTariolle/ROSE-RandomSkin)**: Random skin selection feature
- **[ROSE-HistoricMode](https://github.com/FlorentTariolle/ROSE-HistoricMode)**: Access to the last used skin for every champion

## How It Works

1. **League Client Integration**: Rose activates **[Pengu Loader](https://github.com/FlorentTariolle/ROSE-Pengu)** on startup, which injects the JavaScript plugins into the League Client
2. **Skin Detection**: When you hover over a skin in champion select, [`ROSE-SkinMonitor`](https://github.com/Alban1911/ROSE-SkinMonitor) detects the selection and sends it to the Python backend
3. **Game Opening Delay**: To make sure the injection has time to occur we suspend League of Legend's game process as long as the overlay is not ran
4. **Game Injection**: Using CSLOL tools, Rose injects the selected skin when the game starts
5. **Seamless Experience**: The skin loads as if you owned it, with full chroma support and no gameplay impact (Rose will never provide any feature that gives a competitive advantage to its users)

## Features

- **Automatic Skin Detection**: Detects skin selections through hover events in champion select
- **All Skins Accessible**: Access to every skin for every champion
- **Chroma Support**: Select any chroma variant through the enhanced UI
- **Random Skin Mode**: Automatically select random skins
- **Historic Mode**: Access last used skin on every champion
- **Smart Injection**: Never injects skins you already own
- **Safe & Compatible**: Uses CSLOL injection tools compatible with Riot Vanguard
- **Multi-Language Support**: Works with any client language
- **Open Source**: Fully open source and extensible
- **Free**: If you bought this software, you got scammed 💀
